Sauron desired to be a God-King, and was held to be this by his servants; if he had been victorious he would have demanded divine honour from all rational creatures and absolute temporal power over the whole world.\n"},"1148":{"quote":"I shall not be dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night!

Upon the hill-top stood Gandalf, and he was white and cold and no shadow fell on him. The onslaught of Mordor broke like a wave on the beleaguered hills, voices roaring like a tide amid the wreck and crash of arms.\n\nAs if to his eyes some sudden vision had been given, Gandalf stirred; and he turned, looking back north where the skies were pale and clear. Then he lifted up his hands and cried in a loud voice ringing above the din: The Eagles are coming! And many voices answered crying: The Eagles are coming! The Eagles are coming! The hosts of Mordor looked up and wondered what this sign might mean.\n\nThere came Gwaihir the Windlord, and Landroval his brother, greatest of all the Eagles of the North, mightiest of the descendants of old Thorondor, who built his eyries in the inaccessible peaks of the Encircling Mountains when Middle-earth was young. Behind them in long swift lines came all their vassals from the northern mountains, speeding on a gathering wind. Straight down upon the Nazgul they bore, stooping suddenly out of the high airs, and the rush of their wide wings as they passed over was like a gale.\n\nBut the Nazgul turned and fled, and vanished into Mordor's shadows, hearing a sudden terrible call out of the Dark Tower; and even at that moment all the hosts of Mordor trembled, doubt clutched their hearts, their laughter failed, their hands shook and their limbs were loosed. The Power that drove them on and filled them with hate and fury was wavering, its will was removed from them; and now looking in the eyes of their enemies they saw a deadly light and were afraid.\n\nThen all the Captains of the West cried aloud, for their hearts were filled with a new hope in the midst of darkness. Out from the beleaguered hills knights of Gondor, Riders of Rohan, Dunedain of the North, close-serried companies, drove against their wavering foes, piercing the press with the thrust of bitter spears.

And maybe for both these reasons, and you yourself cannot choose between them. \u00c9owyn, do you not love me, or will you not?'\n'I wished to be loved by another,' she answered, 'But I desire no man's pity.'\n'That I know,' he said. 'You desired to have the love of the Lord Aragorn. Because he was high and puissant, and you wished to have renown and glory and to be lifted far above the mean things that crawl on the earth. And as a great captain may to a young soldier he seemed to you admirable. For so he is, a lord among men, the greatest that now is. But when he gave you only understanding and pity, then you desired to have nothing, unless a brave death in battle. Look at me, \u00c9owyn!'\nAnd \u00c9owyn looked at Faramir long and steadily; and Faramir said: 'Do not scorn pity that is the gift of a gentle heart, \u00c9owyn! But I do not offer you my pity, For you are a lady high and valiant and have yourself won renown that shall not be forgotten; and you are a lady beautiful, I deem, beyond even the words of the Elven-tongue to tell. And I love you. Once I pitied your sorrow. But now, were you sorrowless, without fear or any lack, were you the blissful Queen of Gondor, still I would love you. \u00c9owyn do you not love me?'\nThen the heart of \u00c9owyn changed, or else at last she understood it. And suddenly her winter passed, and the sun shone on her.\n'I stand in Minas Anor, the Tower of the Sun,' she said; 'and behold! the Shadow has departed! I will be a sheildmaiden no longer, nor vie with the great Riders, nor take joy only in the songs of slaying. I will be a healer, and love all things that grow and are not barren.' And again she looked at Faramir. 'No longer do I desire to be a queen,' she said.\nThen Faramir laughed merrily. 'That is well,' he said; 'for I am not a king. Yet I will wed with the White Lady of Rohan, if it be her will. And if she will, then let us cross the River and in happier days let us dwell in fair Ithilien and there make a garden. All things will grow with joy there, if the White Lady comes.\n"},"1558":{"quote":"\u2013 \u0421\u0435\u0433\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0435 \u0437\u044a\u043b [...] \u0438 \u0441 \u043d\u0438\u0449\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u043e\u0442 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435. \u0421\u043c\u044a\u0440\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430.\n\u2013 \u0417\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430! \u0414\u0430, \u0441\u044a\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u043c. \u041c\u043d\u043e\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442 \u0441\u043c\u044a\u0440\u0442. \u0410 \u043d\u044f\u043a\u043e\u0438 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u043c\u044a\u0440\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442. \u041c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448 \u043b\u0438 \u0434\u0430 \u0438\u043c \u0433\u043e \u0432\u044a\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0448? \u0422\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044a\u0440\u0437\u0430\u0439 \u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0448 \u0441\u044a\u0441 \u0441\u043c\u044a\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u044a\u0434\u0438. \u0417\u0430\u0449\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0439-\u043c\u044a\u0434\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0438\u0448\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u044a\u0434\u0431\u0430\u0442\u0430.\n","prompt_template":"Summarize the following quote in simple English in a paragraph: \u2013 \u0421\u0435\u0433\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0435 \u0437\u044a\u043b [...] \u0438 \u0441 \u043d\u0438\u0449\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u043e\u0442 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435. \u0421\u043c\u044a\u0440\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430.\n\u2013 \u0417\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430! \u0414\u0430, \u0441\u044a\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u043c. \u041c\u043d\u043e\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442 \u0441\u043c\u044a\u0440\u0442. \u0410 \u043d\u044f\u043a\u043e\u0438 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u043c\u044a\u0440\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442. \u041c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448 \u043b\u0438 \u0434\u0430 \u0438\u043c \u0433\u043e \u0432\u044a\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0448? \u0422\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044a\u0440\u0437\u0430\u0439 \u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0448 \u0441\u044a\u0441 \u0441\u043c\u044a\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u044a\u0434\u0438. \u0417\u0430\u0449\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0439-\u043c\u044a\u0434\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0438\u0448\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u044a\u0434\u0431\u0430\u0442\u0430.\n"},"1559":{"quote":"Deserves death!

I do not say 'simple minds' with contempt: they often see with clarity the simple truth and the absolute ideal to which effort must be directed, even if it is unattainable. Their weakness, however, is twofold. They do not perceive the complexity of any given situation in Time, in which an absolute ideal is enmeshed. They tend to forget that strange element in the World that\nwe call Pity or Mercy, which is also an absolute requirement in moral judgement (since it is present in the Divine nature). In its highest exercise it belongs to God. For finite judges of imperfect knowledge it must lead to the use of two different scales of 'morality'. To ourselves we must present the absolute ideal without compromise, for we do not know our own limits of natural strength\n(+grace), and if we do not aim at the highest we shall certainly fall short of the utmost that we could achieve. To others, in any case of which we know enough to make a judgement, we must apply a scale tempered by 'mercy': that is, since we can with good will do this without the bias inevitable in judgements of ourselves, we must estimate the limits of another's strength and weigh this against the force of particular circumstances.\nI do not think that Frodo's was a moral failure. At the last moment the pressure of the Ring would reach its maximum \u2013 impossible, I should have said, for any one to resist, certainly after long possession, months of increasing torment, and when starved and exhausted.

I do not say 'simple minds' with contempt: they often see with clarity the simple truth and the absolute ideal to which effort must be directed, even if it is unattainable. Their weakness, however, is twofold. They do not perceive the complexity of any given situation in Time, in which an absolute ideal is enmeshed. They tend to forget that strange element in the World that\nwe call Pity or Mercy, which is also an absolute requirement in moral judgement (since it is present in the Divine nature). In its highest exercise it belongs to God. For finite judges of imperfect knowledge it must lead to the use of two different scales of 'morality'. To ourselves we must present the absolute ideal without compromise, for we do not know our own limits of natural strength\n(+grace), and if we do not aim at the highest we shall certainly fall short of the utmost that we could achieve. To others, in any case of which we know enough to make a judgement, we must apply a scale tempered by 'mercy': that is, since we can with good will do this without the bias inevitable in judgements of ourselves, we must estimate the limits of another's strength and weigh this against the force of particular circumstances.\nI do not think that Frodo's was a moral failure. At the last moment the pressure of the Ring would reach its maximum \u2013 impossible, I should have said, for any one to resist, certainly after long possession, months of increasing torment, and when starved and exhausted.

Upon great pedestals founded in the deep waters stood two great kings of stone: still with blurred eyes and crannied brows they frowned upon the North.

But the true road of escape from such weariness is not to be found in the willfully awkward, clumsy, or misshapen, not in making all things dark or unremittingly violent; nor in the mixing of colours on through subtlety to drabness, and the fantastical complication of shapes to the point of silliness and on towards delirium. Before we reach such states we need recovery. We should look at green again, and be startled anew (but not blinded) by blue and yellow and red. We should meet the centaur and the dragon, and then perhaps suddenly behold, like the ancient shepherds, sheep, and dogs, and horses \u2013 and wolves. This recovery fairy-stories help us to make. In that sense only a taste for them may make us, or keep us, childish.\n"},"2412":{"quote":"Let us remember that a traitor may betray himself and do good that he does not intend.

In that land Narog joins Sirion, and they haste no more, but flow broad and quiet through living meads; and all about the shining river are flaglillies like a blossoming forest, and the grass is filled with flowers, like gems, like bells, like flames of red and gold, like a waste of many-coloured stars in a firmament of green. Yet fairest of all are the willows of Nan-tathrin, pale green, or silver in the wind, and the rustle of their innumerable leaves is a spell of music: day and night would flicker by uncounted, while still I stood knee-deep in grass and listened. There I was enchanted, and forgot the Sea in my heart. There I wandered, naming new flowers, or lay adream amid the singing of the birds, and the humming of bees and flies; and there I might still dwell in delight, forsaking all my kin, whether the ships of the Teleri or the swords of the Noldor, but my doom would not so.\n"},"2885":{"quote":"Hope rather that in the end even the least of your desires shall have fruit.
