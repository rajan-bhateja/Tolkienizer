This was because Ilúvatar had conceived the Children entirely on his own, adding them as a new, unexpected element not part of the Ainur's original blueprint. Because the Children were so unique and different from themselves, the Ainur loved them even more, and through them, gained a deeper understanding of Ilúvatar's vast wisdom, which had previously been hidden even from them."}, {"quote": "− Se nur ĝi ne devis okazi en mia epoko, − diris Frodo.\n− Tiel pensas ankaŭ mi, − diris Gandalfo, − kaj tiel pensas ĉiuj, kiuj travivas tiajn epokojn.

They treat all of life, even serious matters, as a form of play, seeing themselves as multi-talented heroes while viewing nature, women, and children merely as tools for their convenience or amusement. Though outwardly charming, generous, and merry, they become ruthlessly unyielding when their will is challenged. Erendis warns that this self-centered immaturity, combined with their eventual boredom with peace, will inevitably lead them back to war and destruction.
