Then at last Pippin took Gandalf's hand.\n\n'Tell me,' he said, 'is there any hope? For Frodo, I mean; or at least mostly for Frodo.'\n\nGandalf put his hand on Pippin's head.

Gandalf initially admits there was never much hope, calling it a \"fool's hope,\" and is deeply troubled by the mention of Cirith Ungol, a dangerous path Frodo might have taken. However, he then finds a cautious glimmer of hope in the news brought by Faramir. Gandalf reasons that because the Enemy has launched his war sooner than expected, while Frodo was still free, his attention will now be divided and focused on the ongoing conflict rather than solely on finding Frodo. This premature attack, Gandalf believes, suggests the Enemy is reacting to something, feeling a sense of haste and fear, which might unexpectedly work in Frodo's favor."}, {"quote": "Here ends the SILMARILLION.
