However, despite these reservations, the speaker agrees to offer advice out of friendship if it is truly demanded."}, {"quote": "Wizards ought to know better: they do know better.

Io vado ora nelle sale di attesa a sedermi accanto ai miei padri, finché il mondo non sia rinnovato. Poiché ora l’oro e l’argento abbandono, e mi reco là dove essi non hanno valore, desidero separarmi da te in amicizia, e ritrattare quello che ho detto e fatto alla Porta. Bilbo piegò un ginocchio a terra, pieno di dolore. Addio, Re sotto la Montagna! egli disse. Amara è stata la nostra avventura, se doveva finire così; e nemmeno una montagna d’oro può essere un adeguato compenso. Tuttavia sono felice di aver condiviso i tuoi pericoli: questo è stato più di quanto un Baggins possa meritare. No! disse Thorin. In te c’è più di quanto tu non sappia, figlio dell’Occidente cortese. Coraggio e saggezza, in giusta misura mischiati. Se un maggior numero di noi stimasse cibo, allegria e canzoni al di sopra dei tesori d’oro, questo sarebbe un mondo più lieto. Ma triste o lieto, ora debbo lasciarlo. Addio!. Allora Bilbo si allontanò, e se ne andò in disparte; tutto solo si sedette avvolto in una coperta e, lo crediate o no, pianse finché i suoi occhi non furono rossi e roca la voce.\n", "summary": "In this emotional farewell, a dying Thorin says goodbye to Bilbo, acknowledging him as a \"good thief\" and explaining he's going to the afterlife where gold holds no value. He wishes to part as friends and apologizes for their past conflict. A heartbroken Bilbo kneels, lamenting the sad end to their adventure and stating that no gold could compensate for it, though he's grateful to have shared the dangers. Thorin then praises Bilbo's courage and wisdom, imparting a final piece of wisdom: the world would be happier if people valued simple joys like food, merriment, and songs more than gold treasures. After Thorin's final goodbye, Bilbo retreats alone and weeps bitterly."}, {"quote": "There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something (or so Thoron said to the young dwarves).\n", "prompt_template": "Summarize the following quote in simple English in a paragraph: There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something (or so Thoron said to the young dwarves).\n", "summary": "This quote means that if you want to discover or locate something, the most effective and essential thing you can do is to actively search for it.
