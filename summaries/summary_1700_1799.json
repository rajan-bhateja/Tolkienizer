It then emphasizes that those who work to cultivate, care for, and improve this environment – much like gardeners tend to a garden to make it flourish – should be highly respected and valued. Essentially, it means that those who nurture peace, well-being, and positive growth in a society are essential and deserve great honor."}, {"quote": "There were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices.
