Meanwhile, \"in his hand was strength\" indicates he was powerful, capable of taking action, and effective in what he did. Together, it paints a picture of someone who was both smart and able to get things done, perhaps a leader who combined wise decision-making with the power to act on those decisions."}, {"quote": "Then are we not to see the merry young hobbits again?\" said Legolas.\n\"I did not say so,\" said Gandalf. \"Who knows?
