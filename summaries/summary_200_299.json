Next, they ask the South Wind, which hints at many lost lives but directs the speaker to the North Wind for specific news. Finally, the North Wind reveals Boromir's heroic fate: he fought bravely against many foes at Amon Hen, where he fell, and his body was carried by the majestic Rauros Falls. The poem concludes with the speaker's enduring grief and a promise to forever look northward in remembrance of Boromir."}, {"quote": "Fear nothing! Have peace until the morning!

Instead of being gentle and putting someone to sleep as a lullaby should, their voice is so loud, off-key, or unpleasant that it would actually wake up even the most deeply asleep and unresponsive person, like a very drunk goblin who would normally be impossible to rouse.

If a soldier is imprisoned by the enemy, don't we consider it his duty to escape?\n", "summary": "This quote argues that while fantasy does allow people to escape from reality, this isn't a flaw but actually its greatest strength. It compares this act of \"escaping\" through fantasy to a soldier who is imprisoned by the enemy: just as we would expect and even consider it the soldier's duty to escape their confinement, the quote suggests that using fantasy to mentally get away from life's difficulties is a good and even necessary thing to do."}, {"quote": "Here you find us sitting on a field of victory, amid the plunder of armies, and you wonder how we came by a few well-earned comforts!\n", "prompt_template": "Summarize the following quote in simple English in a paragraph: Here you find us sitting on a field of victory, amid the plunder of armies, and you wonder how we came by a few well-earned comforts!\n", "summary": "This quote sarcastically explains the origin of the speaker's comfortable lifestyle.

It suggests that someone who appears to be \"wandering\" – exploring different ideas, taking unconventional routes, or not having an immediate fixed destination – might actually be doing so intentionally. They could be on a journey of discovery, learning, or self-exploration, and this unconventional path may lead them to exactly where they need to be, even if it wasn't the way others expected. In essence, not having a straight-line plan doesn't mean you're lost; sometimes, the journey of exploration is the purpose itself."}, {"quote": "For you little gardener and lover of trees, I have only a small gift.
