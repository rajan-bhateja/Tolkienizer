The one was deep and wide and beautiful, but slow and blended with an immeasurable sorrow, from which its beauty chiefly came. The other had now achieved a unity of its own; but it was loud, and vain, and endlessly repeated; and it had little harmony, but rather a clamorous unison as of many trumpets braying upon a few notes. And it essayed to drown the other music by the violence of its voice, but it seemed that its most triumphant notes were taken by the other and woven into its own solemn pattern.\n\nIn the midst of this strife, whereat the halls of Iluvatar shook and a tremor ran out into the silences yet unmoved, Ilu´ vatar arose a third time, and his face was terrible to behold. Then he raised up both his hands, and in one chord, deeper than the Abyss, higher than the Firmament, piercing as the light of the eye of Iluvatar, the Music ceased.\n\nThen Ilu´ vatar spoke, and he said: ‘Mighty are the Ainur, and mightiest among them is Melkor; but that he may know, and all the Ainur, that I am Iluvatar, those things that ye have sung, I will show them forth, that ye may see what ye have done. And thou, Melkor, shalt see that no theme may be played that hath not its uttermost source in me, nor can any alter the music in my despite. For he that attempteth this shall prove but mine instrument in the devising of things more wonderful, which he himself hath not imagined.’\n\nThen the Ainur were afraid, and they did not yet comprehend the words that were said to them; and Melkor was filled with shame, of which came secret anger. But Iluvatar arose in splendour, and he went forth from the fair regions that he had made for the Ainur; and the Ainur followed him.\n", "summary": "The initial quote means that even if one disagrees with or finds something disruptive, they can still accept that it serves a vital role within a larger, divine scheme. This idea is perfectly illustrated in the story of Iluvatar and the Music of the Ainur. When Melkor, the most powerful of the Ainur, introduced his own chaotic and discordant themes into Iluvatar's beautiful creation, he aimed to dominate and destroy the harmony. However, Iluvatar revealed that Melkor's attempts to defy him were futile. Instead of being overthrown, Melkor's loud and vain notes were absorbed and woven into the grander, more profound, and even more sorrowful beauty of the overall Music. Iluvatar declared that no one could truly alter his ultimate plan, and anyone who tried would simply become his instrument, unknowingly contributing to the creation of things far more wonderful than they could ever imagine."}, {"quote": "Sein Zorn war unbeschreiblich - ein Zorn, wie man ihn nur bei reichen Leuten erleben kann, die mehr haben, als sie brauchen, und plötzlich etwas verlieren, das sie schon lange besitzen, aber noch nie benutzt oder benötigt haben.\n", "prompt_template": "Summarize the following quote in simple English in a paragraph: Sein Zorn war unbeschreiblich - ein Zorn, wie man ihn nur bei reichen Leuten erleben kann, die mehr haben, als sie brauchen, und plötzlich etwas verlieren, das sie schon lange besitzen, aber noch nie benutzt oder benötigt haben.\n", "summary": "His anger was immense, a fury typically seen only in very wealthy people.
