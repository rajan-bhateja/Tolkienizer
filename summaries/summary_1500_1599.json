Beyond this cosmic enchantment, the Kalevala also offers exciting stories of powerful, sometimes mischievous, ancient villains, all to be appreciated in the context of a simple, traditional Finnish life, like relaxing in a sauna after a day of work in the peaceful countryside."}, {"quote": "Melkor's envy grew then the greater within him; and he also took visible form, but because of his mood and the malice that burned in him that form was dark and terrible.
