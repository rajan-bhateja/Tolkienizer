If you dive into a complicated task without a pre-existing structure or guide, it will be impossible to go back and make sense of it, organize it logically, or understand how all the pieces fit together once it's finished. Essentially, you can't create order or a clear understanding of something intricate *after* the fact if you didn't build it with a plan in mind."}, {"quote": "He raised his staff.
