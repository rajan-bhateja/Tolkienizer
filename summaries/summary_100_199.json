What was once factual history slowly becomes exaggerated stories, known as legends. These legends then fade further, turning into ancient myths that seem almost unbelievable. As a result of this long process of forgetting and distorting the past, something crucial, like the ring mentioned, can be completely lost from everyone's knowledge for thousands of years."}, {"quote": "It was at this point that Bilbo stopped.
