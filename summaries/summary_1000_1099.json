Despite this physical end, the speaker declares with conviction that the sun still shines above all shadows and the stars remain forever.

She was little changed, for the mortal years had passed her by, yet her face was more grave, and her laughter now seldom was heard. But Aragorn was grown to full stature of body and mind, and Galadriel bade him cast aside his wayworn raiment, and she clothed him in silver and white, with a cloak of elven-grey and a bright gem on his brow. Then more than any kind of Men he appeared, and seemed rather an Elf-lord from the Isles of the West. And thus it was that Arwen first beheld him again after their long parting; and as he came walking towards her under the trees of Caras Galadhon laden with flowers of gold, her choice was made and her doom appointed.\n", "summary": "Arwen was present, looking more serious even though she hadn't aged, visiting her mother's family. Meanwhile, Aragorn had matured into a full-grown man. Galadriel then dressed him in splendid silver and white clothes, an elven-grey cloak, and a bright gem on his forehead, which made him appear more like a noble Elf-lord than a man. It was in this striking appearance that Arwen saw him again after a long separation. As he walked towards her under the trees, carrying golden flowers, she made her profound choice about her future and sealed her destiny."}, {"quote": "He was going to learn about sheep, and the high pasturages, and look at a wider sky, and walk ever further and further towards the Mountains, always uphill.

The speaker admits not knowing what happens to this person beyond that point. It then contrasts this with another character, Niggle, who could only glimpse these Mountains from afar and include them in his art.
