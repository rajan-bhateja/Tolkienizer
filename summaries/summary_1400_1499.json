[{"quote": "So time drew on to the War of the Ring, and the sons of Denethor grew to manhood. Boromir, five years the elder, beloved by his father, was like him in face and pride, but in little else. Rather he was a man after the sort of King Eärnur of old, taking no wife and delighting chiefly in arms; fearless and strong, but caring little for lore, save the tales of old battles. Faramir the younger was like him in looks but otherwise in mind. He read the hearts of men as shrewdly as his father, but what he read moved him sooner to pity than to scorn. He was gentle in bearing, and a lover of lore and of music, and therefore by many in those days his courage was judged less than his brother’s. But it was not so, except that he did not seek glory in danger without a purpose.

Boromir, the elder, was his father's favorite: proud, fearless, and a mighty warrior who cared little for learning, except for battle tales. Faramir, the younger, looked similar but was gentle and compassionate, loving books and music. He was wise and welcomed Gandalf's counsel, which displeased his father. Many underestimated Faramir's courage because of his gentle nature, but he was truly brave, just not reckless in seeking glory. Despite their contrasting personalities and their father's clear favoritism, the brothers shared a deep love and no jealousy. Both believed Boromir was unmatched in Gondor, though things would later change."}, {"quote": "A few melancholy birds were pipping and wailing, until the round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows; then an empty silence fell\n", "prompt_template": "Summarize the following quote in simple English in a paragraph: A few melancholy birds were pipping and wailing, until the round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows; then an empty silence fell\n", "summary": "The quote describes a quiet evening scene where a few sad-sounding birds were making soft, mournful calls.
