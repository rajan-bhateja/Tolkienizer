Frodo's \"failure\" was not a moral one; the Ring's power at its peak was overwhelming, impossible for anyone to resist after such a long ordeal. He had pushed himself to his absolute limit, successfully creating the situation where the Ring could be destroyed, and his earlier mercy towards Gollum ultimately saved the quest and earned him grace.
