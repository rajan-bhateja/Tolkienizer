Instead of hurting the target of your hatred, it often makes *you* unhappy, stressed, and focused on negativity. Essentially, the person who suffers most from hatred is usually the one who feels it."}, {"quote": "There were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside; and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several years, Frodo gathered all the news he could.

The speaker then reflects on their own life's journey, which began at their front door. They describe following this path with eager enthusiasm at first, but later with tired feet, recognizing that their personal road, like all roads, goes on and on.
