Even the less potent rings, though considered minor by their makers, were dangerous for mortals. The most powerful ones, known as the Great Rings or Rings of Power, were incredibly perilous. A mortal who kept one of these Great Rings would not die, but would stop growing and simply continue to exist, with every moment becoming a burden. If they frequently used the Ring to become invisible, they would slowly fade away, eventually becoming permanently unseen and trapped in a shadowy world, under the control of a sinister Dark Power. Sooner or later, this Dark Power would completely consume them, no matter how strong or well-intentioned they were at first."}, {"quote": "do not despise the lore that has come down from distant years; for oft it may chance that old wives keep in memory word of things that once were needful for the wise to know.\n", "prompt_template": "Summarize the following quote in simple English in a paragraph: do not despise the lore that has come down from distant years; for oft it may chance that old wives keep in memory word of things that once were needful for the wise to know.\n", "summary": "This quote advises us not to dismiss old knowledge or traditions that have been passed down through many years.
