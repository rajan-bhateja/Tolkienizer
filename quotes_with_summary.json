From the high walls westward I looked afar.\nBut you came not from the empty lands where no men are.\n\nFrom the mouth of the sea the South Wind flies,\nFrom the sand hills and the stones;\nThe wailing of the gulls it bears, and at the gate it moans\nWhat news from the South, oh sighing wind, do you bring to me at eve?\nWhere now is Boromir the Fair? He tarries and I grieve.\n‘Ask me not where he doth dwell--so many bones there lie\nOn the white shores and on the black shores under the stormy sky;\nSo many have passed down Anduin to find the flowing sea.\nAsk of the North Wind news of them the North Wind sends to me!’\nOh Boromir! Beyond the gate the Seaward road runs South,\nBut you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey seas mouth.\n\nFrom the Gate of Kings the North Wind rides,\nAnd past the roaring falls\nAnd loud and cold about the Tower its loud horn calls.\nWhat news from the North, oh mighty wind, do you bring to me today?\nWhat news of Boromir the Bold? For he is long away.\n‘Beneath Amon Hen I heard his cry. There many foes he fought\nHis cloven shield, his broken sword, they to the water brought.\nHis head so proud, his face so fair, his limbs they laid to rest;\nAnd Rauros, Golden Rauros Falls, bore him upon its breast.’\nOh Boromir! The Tower of Guard shall ever northward gaze\nTo Rauros, Golden Rauros Falls until the end of days.\n", "summary": "This poem is a mournful lament from a speaker desperately seeking news of Boromir. They question the West Wind, which offers vague information, suggesting Boromir passed away into the North. Next, they ask the South Wind, which hints at many lost lives but directs the speaker to the North Wind for specific news. Finally, the North Wind reveals Boromir's heroic fate: he fought bravely against many foes at Amon Hen, where he fell, and his body was carried by the majestic Rauros Falls. The poem concludes with the speaker's enduring grief and a promise to forever look northward in remembrance of Boromir."}, {"quote": "Fear nothing! Have peace until the morning!

It stepped forward slowly onto the bridge, and suddenly it drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to wall; but still Gandalf could be seen, glimmering in the gloom; he seemed small, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm.\n\nFrom out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming.\n\nGlamdring glittered white in answer.\n\nThere was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire. The Balrog fell back and its sword flew up in molten fragments. The wizard swayed on the bridge, stepped back a pace, and then again stood still.\n\n'You cannot pass!' he said.\n\nWith a bound the Balrog leaped full upon the bridge. Its whip whirled and hissed.\n\n'He cannot stand alone!' cried Aragorn suddenly and ran back along the bridge. 'Elendil!' he shouted. 'I am with you, Gandalf!'\n\n'Gondor!' cried Boromir and leaped after him.\n\nAt that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, and crying aloud he smote the bridge before him. The staff broke asunder and fell from his hand. A blinding sheet of white flame sprang up. The bridge cracked. Right at the Balrog's feet it broke, and the stone upon which it stood crashed into the gulf, while the rest remained, poised, quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness.\n\nWith a terrible cry the Balrog fell forward, and its shadow plunged down and vanished. But even as it fell it swung its whip, and the thongs lashed and curled about the wizard's knees, dragging him to the brink. He staggered and fell, grasped vainly at the stone, and slid into the abyss. 'Fly, you fools!' he cried, and was gone.\n", "summary": "On a narrow bridge, the wizard Gandalf bravely confronted the monstrous Balrog, declaring it could not pass. Despite the creature's menacing display of fire and whip, Gandalf stood firm and engaged it in battle, shattering its flaming sword. As his companions Aragorn and Boromir tried to rush to his aid, Gandalf made a desperate, powerful move: he struck the bridge with his staff, causing it to break directly beneath the Balrog, sending the creature plunging into the abyss. However, as the Balrog fell, its whip lashed out, catching Gandalf and dragging him over the edge as well. With a final cry of \"Fly, you fools!\" to his friends, Gandalf too vanished into the darkness below."}, {"quote": "Instead of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen, not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn!

They lament that globalization, driven by the spread of American culture—including its sanitation, moral attitudes, feminism, and mass production—is making the entire world feel like one bland suburb, leaving no unique places left to explore. Furthermore, they are dismayed by the dominance of English, wishing for a return to linguistic diversity, even satirically suggesting people should only say \"baa baa.\" As an act of rebellion against this conformity, the speaker declares they will only speak an obscure, ancient dialect."}, {"quote": "Es cierto que el mundo esta colmado de peligros y que hay en él sitios lóbregos, pero hay también cosas hermosas y aunque en todas partes el amor está unido hoy a la aflicción, no por eso es menos poderoso.\n", "prompt_template": "Summarize the following quote in simple English in a paragraph: Es cierto que el mundo esta colmado de peligros y que hay en él sitios lóbregos, pero hay también cosas hermosas y aunque en todas partes el amor está unido hoy a la aflicción, no por eso es menos poderoso.\n", "summary": "This quote acknowledges that the world is indeed full of dangers and dark places.

However, Iluvatar revealed that Melkor's attempts to defy him were futile. Instead of being overthrown, Melkor's loud and vain notes were absorbed and woven into the grander, more profound, and even more sorrowful beauty of the overall Music. Iluvatar declared that no one could truly alter his ultimate plan, and anyone who tried would simply become his instrument, unknowingly contributing to the creation of things far more wonderful than they could ever imagine."}, {"quote": "Sein Zorn war unbeschreiblich - ein Zorn, wie man ihn nur bei reichen Leuten erleben kann, die mehr haben, als sie brauchen, und plötzlich etwas verlieren, das sie schon lange besitzen, aber noch nie benutzt oder benötigt haben.\n", "prompt_template": "Summarize the following quote in simple English in a paragraph: Sein Zorn war unbeschreiblich - ein Zorn, wie man ihn nur bei reichen Leuten erleben kann, die mehr haben, als sie brauchen, und plötzlich etwas verlieren, das sie schon lange besitzen, aber noch nie benutzt oder benötigt haben.\n", "summary": "His anger was immense, a fury typically seen only in very wealthy people.
