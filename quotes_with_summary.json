It also emphasizes that things with deep, strong foundations will endure difficult times, just as deep roots are protected from the cold. Furthermore, it offers a hopeful message: even after destruction or despair, new life and light will emerge, what was broken will be restored, and those who lost their power or rightful place will eventually reclaim it."}, {"quote": "Not all those who wander are lost.\n", "prompt_template": "Summarize the following quote in simple English in a paragraph: Not all those who wander are lost.\n", "summary": "This quote means that someone who appears to be wandering or not following a conventional path is not necessarily without purpose or direction. It challenges the common assumption that a lack of a clear, fixed destination automatically implies confusion or aimlessness. Instead, it suggests that exploring, deviating, or taking an unconventional route can be a deliberate choice, leading to discovery, learning, and finding one's own unique way, even if the journey looks different to others."}, {"quote": "I wish it need not have happened in my time,\" said Frodo.\n\"So do I,\" said Gandalf, \"and so do all who live to see such times.

I saw him then no more.\nThe North Wind may have heard the horn of the son of Denethor.’\nOh, Boromir! From the high walls westward I looked afar.\nBut you came not from the empty lands where no men are.\n\nFrom the mouth of the sea the South Wind flies,\nFrom the sand hills and the stones;\nThe wailing of the gulls it bears, and at the gate it moans\nWhat news from the South, oh sighing wind, do you bring to me at eve?\nWhere now is Boromir the Fair? He tarries and I grieve.\n‘Ask me not where he doth dwell--so many bones there lie\nOn the white shores and on the black shores under the stormy sky;\nSo many have passed down Anduin to find the flowing sea.\nAsk of the North Wind news of them the North Wind sends to me!’\nOh Boromir! Beyond the gate the Seaward road runs South,\nBut you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey seas mouth.\n\nFrom the Gate of Kings the North Wind rides,\nAnd past the roaring falls\nAnd loud and cold about the Tower its loud horn calls.\nWhat news from the North, oh mighty wind, do you bring to me today?\nWhat news of Boromir the Bold? For he is long away.\n‘Beneath Amon Hen I heard his cry. There many foes he fought\nHis cloven shield, his broken sword, they to the water brought.\nHis head so proud, his face so fair, his limbs they laid to rest;\nAnd Rauros, Golden Rauros Falls, bore him upon its breast.’\nOh Boromir! The Tower of Guard shall ever northward gaze\nTo Rauros, Golden Rauros Falls until the end of days.\n", "summary": "This poem is a mournful lament from a speaker desperately seeking news of Boromir. They question the West Wind, which offers vague information, suggesting Boromir passed away into the North. Next, they ask the South Wind, which hints at many lost lives but directs the speaker to the North Wind for specific news. Finally, the North Wind reveals Boromir's heroic fate: he fought bravely against many foes at Amon Hen, where he fell, and his body was carried by the majestic Rauros Falls. The poem concludes with the speaker's enduring grief and a promise to forever look northward in remembrance of Boromir."}, {"quote": "Fear nothing! Have peace until the morning!

We hates it, we hates it, we hates it forever!\n", "summary": "This quote expresses intense anger and resentment towards someone named Baggins, who is repeatedly called a \"thief.\" The speaker, likely Gollum, is furious because Baggins has taken something precious from them. Their hatred for Baggins and the act of theft is so profound and deeply felt that they declare it will last forever, showing an inability to forgive or forget the perceived wrong."}, {"quote": "Your lullaby would waken a drunken goblin!\n", "prompt_template": "Summarize the following quote in simple English in a paragraph: Your lullaby would waken a drunken goblin!\n", "summary": "This humorous but harsh quote means that someone's singing, especially their \"lullaby,\" is incredibly bad and un-soothing. Instead of being gentle and putting someone to sleep as a lullaby should, their voice is so loud, off-key, or unpleasant that it would actually wake up even the most deeply asleep and unresponsive person, like a very drunk goblin who would normally be impossible to rouse.

If a soldier is imprisoned by the enemy, don't we consider it his duty to escape?\n", "summary": "This quote argues that while fantasy does allow people to escape from reality, this isn't a flaw but actually its greatest strength. It compares this act of \"escaping\" through fantasy to a soldier who is imprisoned by the enemy: just as we would expect and even consider it the soldier's duty to escape their confinement, the quote suggests that using fantasy to mentally get away from life's difficulties is a good and even necessary thing to do."}, {"quote": "Here you find us sitting on a field of victory, amid the plunder of armies, and you wonder how we came by a few well-earned comforts!\n", "prompt_template": "Summarize the following quote in simple English in a paragraph: Here you find us sitting on a field of victory, amid the plunder of armies, and you wonder how we came by a few well-earned comforts!\n", "summary": "This quote sarcastically explains the origin of the speaker's comfortable lifestyle.

It suggests that someone who appears to be \"wandering\" – exploring different ideas, taking unconventional routes, or not having an immediate fixed destination – might actually be doing so intentionally. They could be on a journey of discovery, learning, or self-exploration, and this unconventional path may lead them to exactly where they need to be, even if it wasn't the way others expected. In essence, not having a straight-line plan doesn't mean you're lost; sometimes, the journey of exploration is the purpose itself."}, {"quote": "For you little gardener and lover of trees, I have only a small gift.
