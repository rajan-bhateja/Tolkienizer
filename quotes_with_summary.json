It also emphasizes that things with deep, strong foundations will endure difficult times, just as deep roots are protected from the cold. Furthermore, it offers a hopeful message: even after destruction or despair, new life and light will emerge, what was broken will be restored, and those who lost their power or rightful place will eventually reclaim it."}, {"quote": "Not all those who wander are lost.\n", "prompt_template": "Summarize the following quote in simple English in a paragraph: Not all those who wander are lost.\n", "summary": "This quote means that someone who appears to be wandering or not following a conventional path is not necessarily without purpose or direction. It challenges the common assumption that a lack of a clear, fixed destination automatically implies confusion or aimlessness. Instead, it suggests that exploring, deviating, or taking an unconventional route can be a deliberate choice, leading to discovery, learning, and finding one's own unique way, even if the journey looks different to others."}, {"quote": "I wish it need not have happened in my time,\" said Frodo.\n\"So do I,\" said Gandalf, \"and so do all who live to see such times.

I saw him then no more.\nThe North Wind may have heard the horn of the son of Denethor.’\nOh, Boromir! From the high walls westward I looked afar.\nBut you came not from the empty lands where no men are.\n\nFrom the mouth of the sea the South Wind flies,\nFrom the sand hills and the stones;\nThe wailing of the gulls it bears, and at the gate it moans\nWhat news from the South, oh sighing wind, do you bring to me at eve?\nWhere now is Boromir the Fair? He tarries and I grieve.\n‘Ask me not where he doth dwell--so many bones there lie\nOn the white shores and on the black shores under the stormy sky;\nSo many have passed down Anduin to find the flowing sea.\nAsk of the North Wind news of them the North Wind sends to me!’\nOh Boromir! Beyond the gate the Seaward road runs South,\nBut you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey seas mouth.\n\nFrom the Gate of Kings the North Wind rides,\nAnd past the roaring falls\nAnd loud and cold about the Tower its loud horn calls.\nWhat news from the North, oh mighty wind, do you bring to me today?\nWhat news of Boromir the Bold? For he is long away.\n‘Beneath Amon Hen I heard his cry. There many foes he fought\nHis cloven shield, his broken sword, they to the water brought.\nHis head so proud, his face so fair, his limbs they laid to rest;\nAnd Rauros, Golden Rauros Falls, bore him upon its breast.’\nOh Boromir! The Tower of Guard shall ever northward gaze\nTo Rauros, Golden Rauros Falls until the end of days.\n", "summary": "This poem is a mournful lament from a speaker desperately seeking news of Boromir. They question the West Wind, which offers vague information, suggesting Boromir passed away into the North. Next, they ask the South Wind, which hints at many lost lives but directs the speaker to the North Wind for specific news. Finally, the North Wind reveals Boromir's heroic fate: he fought bravely against many foes at Amon Hen, where he fell, and his body was carried by the majestic Rauros Falls. The poem concludes with the speaker's enduring grief and a promise to forever look northward in remembrance of Boromir."}, {"quote": "Fear nothing! Have peace until the morning!

But Gandalf stood firm.\n\n'You cannot pass,' he said. The orcs stood still, and a dead silence fell. 'I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass.'\n\nThe Balrog made no answer. The fire in it seemed to die, but the darkness grew. It stepped forward slowly onto the bridge, and suddenly it drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to wall; but still Gandalf could be seen, glimmering in the gloom; he seemed small, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm.\n\nFrom out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming.\n\nGlamdring glittered white in answer.\n\nThere was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire. The Balrog fell back and its sword flew up in molten fragments. The wizard swayed on the bridge, stepped back a pace, and then again stood still.\n\n'You cannot pass!' he said.\n\nWith a bound the Balrog leaped full upon the bridge. Its whip whirled and hissed.\n\n'He cannot stand alone!' cried Aragorn suddenly and ran back along the bridge. 'Elendil!' he shouted. 'I am with you, Gandalf!'\n\n'Gondor!' cried Boromir and leaped after him.\n\nAt that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, and crying aloud he smote the bridge before him. The staff broke asunder and fell from his hand. A blinding sheet of white flame sprang up. The bridge cracked. Right at the Balrog's feet it broke, and the stone upon which it stood crashed into the gulf, while the rest remained, poised, quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness.\n\nWith a terrible cry the Balrog fell forward, and its shadow plunged down and vanished. But even as it fell it swung its whip, and the thongs lashed and curled about the wizard's knees, dragging him to the brink. He staggered and fell, grasped vainly at the stone, and slid into the abyss. 'Fly, you fools!' he cried, and was gone.\n", "summary": "On a narrow bridge, the wizard Gandalf bravely confronted the monstrous Balrog, declaring it could not pass. Despite the creature's menacing display of fire and whip, Gandalf stood firm and engaged it in battle, shattering its flaming sword. As his companions Aragorn and Boromir tried to rush to his aid, Gandalf made a desperate, powerful move: he struck the bridge with his staff, causing it to break directly beneath the Balrog, sending the creature plunging into the abyss. However, as the Balrog fell, its whip lashed out, catching Gandalf and dragging him over the edge as well. With a final cry of \"Fly, you fools!\" to his friends, Gandalf too vanished into the darkness below."}, {"quote": "Instead of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen, not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn!

As Winter approaches and both their lands become harsh and barren, a change occurs: the Ent declares he will seek her out, and the Entwife agrees, ready to meet him.

Frodo's \"failure\" was not a moral one; the Ring's power at its peak was overwhelming, impossible for anyone to resist after such a long ordeal. He had pushed himself to his absolute limit, successfully creating the situation where the Ring could be destroyed, and his earlier mercy towards Gollum ultimately saved the quest and earned him grace.

In the house of Elrond it is told that they were at Annúminas, and Amon Súl, and Elendil’s Stone was on the Tower Hills that look towards Mithlond in the Gulf of Lune where the grey ships lie. ‘Each palantír replied to each, but all those in Gondor were ever open to the view of Osgiliath. Now it appears that, as the rock of Orthanc has withstood the storms of time, so there the palantír of that tower has remained. But alone it could do nothing but see small images of things far off and days remote. Very useful, no doubt, that was to Saruman; yet it seems that he was not content. Further and further abroad he gazed, until he cast his gaze upon Barad-dûr. Then he was caught! ‘Who knows where the lost Stones of Arnor and Gondor now lie, buried, or drowned deep? But one at least Sauron must have obtained and mastered to his purposes. I guess that it was the Ithil-stone, for he took Minas Ithil long ago and turned it into an evil place: Minas Morgul, it has become. ‘Easy it is now to guess how quickly the roving eye of Saruman was trapped and held; and how ever since he has been persuaded from afar, and daunted when persuasion\n", "summary": "This quote describes the ancient seeing stones called Palantíri. Three of these stones were located in the North, at Annúminas, Amon Súl, and the Tower Hills. All the Palantíri were interconnected, especially those in Gondor, which could always view Osgiliath. The Palantír in Orthanc's tower survived, and Saruman used it. Initially, it only showed him distant and past events, but Saruman, seeking more, gazed further until he connected with Sauron's fortress, Barad-dûr, and was trapped. It's suggested that Sauron obtained and mastered at least one Palantír, likely the Ithil-stone from Minas Morgul. This explains how Sauron was able to ensnare and control Saruman from afar through their respective stones."}, {"quote": "I serve no man,’ said Aragorn; ‘but the servants of Sauron I pursue into whatever land they may go.
