It also emphasizes that things with deep, strong foundations will endure difficult times, just as deep roots are protected from the cold. Furthermore, it offers a hopeful message: even after destruction or despair, new life and light will emerge, what was broken will be restored, and those who lost their power or rightful place will eventually reclaim it."}, {"quote": "Not all those who wander are lost.\n", "prompt_template": "Summarize the following quote in simple English in a paragraph: Not all those who wander are lost.\n", "summary": "This quote means that someone who appears to be wandering or not following a conventional path is not necessarily without purpose or direction. It challenges the common assumption that a lack of a clear, fixed destination automatically implies confusion or aimlessness. Instead, it suggests that exploring, deviating, or taking an unconventional route can be a deliberate choice, leading to discovery, learning, and finding one's own unique way, even if the journey looks different to others."}, {"quote": "I wish it need not have happened in my time,\" said Frodo.\n\"So do I,\" said Gandalf, \"and so do all who live to see such times.
