It also emphasizes that things with deep, strong foundations will endure difficult times, just as deep roots are protected from the cold. Furthermore, it offers a hopeful message: even after destruction or despair, new life and light will emerge, what was broken will be restored, and those who lost their power or rightful place will eventually reclaim it."}, {"quote": "Not all those who wander are lost.\n", "prompt_template": "Summarize the following quote in simple English in a paragraph: Not all those who wander are lost.\n", "summary": "This quote means that someone who appears to be wandering or not following a conventional path is not necessarily without purpose or direction. It challenges the common assumption that a lack of a clear, fixed destination automatically implies confusion or aimlessness. Instead, it suggests that exploring, deviating, or taking an unconventional route can be a deliberate choice, leading to discovery, learning, and finding one's own unique way, even if the journey looks different to others."}, {"quote": "I wish it need not have happened in my time,\" said Frodo.\n\"So do I,\" said Gandalf, \"and so do all who live to see such times.

I saw him then no more.\nThe North Wind may have heard the horn of the son of Denethor.’\nOh, Boromir! From the high walls westward I looked afar.\nBut you came not from the empty lands where no men are.\n\nFrom the mouth of the sea the South Wind flies,\nFrom the sand hills and the stones;\nThe wailing of the gulls it bears, and at the gate it moans\nWhat news from the South, oh sighing wind, do you bring to me at eve?\nWhere now is Boromir the Fair? He tarries and I grieve.\n‘Ask me not where he doth dwell--so many bones there lie\nOn the white shores and on the black shores under the stormy sky;\nSo many have passed down Anduin to find the flowing sea.\nAsk of the North Wind news of them the North Wind sends to me!’\nOh Boromir! Beyond the gate the Seaward road runs South,\nBut you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey seas mouth.\n\nFrom the Gate of Kings the North Wind rides,\nAnd past the roaring falls\nAnd loud and cold about the Tower its loud horn calls.\nWhat news from the North, oh mighty wind, do you bring to me today?\nWhat news of Boromir the Bold? For he is long away.\n‘Beneath Amon Hen I heard his cry. There many foes he fought\nHis cloven shield, his broken sword, they to the water brought.\nHis head so proud, his face so fair, his limbs they laid to rest;\nAnd Rauros, Golden Rauros Falls, bore him upon its breast.’\nOh Boromir! The Tower of Guard shall ever northward gaze\nTo Rauros, Golden Rauros Falls until the end of days.\n", "summary": "This poem is a mournful lament from a speaker desperately seeking news of Boromir. They question the West Wind, which offers vague information, suggesting Boromir passed away into the North. Next, they ask the South Wind, which hints at many lost lives but directs the speaker to the North Wind for specific news. Finally, the North Wind reveals Boromir's heroic fate: he fought bravely against many foes at Amon Hen, where he fell, and his body was carried by the majestic Rauros Falls. The poem concludes with the speaker's enduring grief and a promise to forever look northward in remembrance of Boromir."}, {"quote": "Fear nothing! Have peace until the morning!

But Gandalf stood firm.\n\n'You cannot pass,' he said. The orcs stood still, and a dead silence fell. 'I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass.'\n\nThe Balrog made no answer. The fire in it seemed to die, but the darkness grew. It stepped forward slowly onto the bridge, and suddenly it drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to wall; but still Gandalf could be seen, glimmering in the gloom; he seemed small, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm.\n\nFrom out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming.\n\nGlamdring glittered white in answer.\n\nThere was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire. The Balrog fell back and its sword flew up in molten fragments. The wizard swayed on the bridge, stepped back a pace, and then again stood still.\n\n'You cannot pass!' he said.\n\nWith a bound the Balrog leaped full upon the bridge. Its whip whirled and hissed.\n\n'He cannot stand alone!' cried Aragorn suddenly and ran back along the bridge. 'Elendil!' he shouted. 'I am with you, Gandalf!'\n\n'Gondor!' cried Boromir and leaped after him.\n\nAt that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, and crying aloud he smote the bridge before him. The staff broke asunder and fell from his hand. A blinding sheet of white flame sprang up. The bridge cracked. Right at the Balrog's feet it broke, and the stone upon which it stood crashed into the gulf, while the rest remained, poised, quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness.\n\nWith a terrible cry the Balrog fell forward, and its shadow plunged down and vanished. But even as it fell it swung its whip, and the thongs lashed and curled about the wizard's knees, dragging him to the brink. He staggered and fell, grasped vainly at the stone, and slid into the abyss. 'Fly, you fools!' he cried, and was gone.\n", "summary": "On a narrow bridge, the wizard Gandalf bravely confronted the monstrous Balrog, declaring it could not pass. Despite the creature's menacing display of fire and whip, Gandalf stood firm and engaged it in battle, shattering its flaming sword. As his companions Aragorn and Boromir tried to rush to his aid, Gandalf made a desperate, powerful move: he struck the bridge with his staff, causing it to break directly beneath the Balrog, sending the creature plunging into the abyss. However, as the Balrog fell, its whip lashed out, catching Gandalf and dragging him over the edge as well. With a final cry of \"Fly, you fools!\" to his friends, Gandalf too vanished into the darkness below."}, {"quote": "Instead of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen, not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn!

He discovered many elements and characters as he went along, rather than having them all planned out from the beginning. He felt the same shock and mystery as his characters, like Frodo. For instance, he hadn't known about places like Bree or the Mines of Moria, nor did he initially know about characters like Strider or the evil wizard Saruman. Even major plot points, like Gandalf's unexpected absence, were as much a mystery to him as they were to Frodo."}]
